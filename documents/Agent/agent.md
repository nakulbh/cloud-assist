# Cloud-Assist Agent Architecture

## Overview

The Cloud-Assist agent serves as the intelligent core of your DevOps terminal application, bridging natural language understanding with contextual awareness of DevOps tooling and infrastructure. This document outlines the agent architecture, components, and implementation approach.

## Agent Design Principles

1. **Contextual Awareness**: Maintain understanding of infrastructure state across interactions
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Suggest commands incrementally, building towards complete solutions
3. **Explainability**: Provide clear rationales for suggested commands
4. **Safety First**: Never execute potentially destructive operations without explicit approval
5. **Learning from Feedback**: Improve suggestions based on user acceptance/rejection patterns

## Agent Architecture

The Cloud-Assist agent follows a modular architecture with the following components:

```

### Core Components

#### 1. Intent Parser

Responsible for understanding the user's natural language request and extracting:
- Primary action (install, configure, monitor, troubleshoot)
- Target resources (containers, databases, networks)
- Constraints and preferences (versions, regions, performance requirements)
- Success criteria (what does "done" look like for this request)

Implementation approach:
- Use a combination of keyword extraction and semantic parsing
- Map common DevOps terminology to intent categories
- Support clarification requests when intent is ambiguous

#### 2. Context Manager

Maintains a stateful understanding of:
- Previous commands and their results
- Infrastructure state (discovered services, configurations)
- User's environment (OS, installed tools, cloud provider)
- Command dependencies and prerequisites

Implementation approach:
- Build a graph-based context store tracking resources and relationships
- Implement retention policies for context size management
- Support explicit context saving/loading between sessions

#### 3. Command Generator

Converts parsed intent into executable shell commands by:
- Selecting appropriate tools based on context (kubectl, terraform, docker, etc.)
- Constructing syntactically correct command arguments
- Applying best practices and user preferences
- Generating command sequences for multi-step operations

Implementation approach:
- Template-based generation with parameter substitution
- Decision tree for tool selection based on context
- Validation of generated commands against syntax rules

#### 4. Output Analyzer

Processes command execution results to:
- Determine success/failure status
- Extract relevant information for context updates
- Identify warning conditions requiring attention
- Inform next command selection based on results

Implementation approach:
- Pattern matching for common output formats
- Error classification into recoverable/non-recoverable categories
- Key information extraction for updating context

### Integration Layer

#### 1. Model Interface

Provides a consistent abstraction over different AI models:
- Supports prompt construction and response parsing
- Handles model-specific parameters and limitations
- Enables switching between different models

Implementation options:
- **Local Models**: Support for embedding language models locally for air-gapped environments
- **Remote APIs**: Integration with OpenAI, Anthropic, or other API providers

#### 2. Command Executor

Manages the safe execution of shell commands:
- Validates commands against safety rules
- Handles command approval workflow
- Executes approved commands in appropriate environment
- Captures and structures command output

Implementation approach:
- Use OS-specific terminal integration
- Support for sandboxing high-risk commands
- Configurable approval modes (manual, semi-automated, automatic)

## Agent Types & Implementation Options

Based on your project needs, you should implement a **hybrid agent architecture** with the following characteristics:

### 1. MCP-Based Agent

Use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as documented in your project to create a standardized interface between the AI model and your DevOps tools. This approach provides:

- **Structured Tool Definitions**: Clear schemas for all DevOps operations
- **Standardized Approval Flow**: Consistent security model across operations
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new tools and capabilities

Implementation:
- Implement the MCP server component as described in your `mcp-features.md`
- Define tool schemas for common DevOps operations
- Use the approval flow for command execution

### 2. Multi-stage Reasoning Agent

Employ a multi-stage reasoning approach where the agent:
1. **Analyzes** the user's request to understand intent
2. **Plans** a sequence of operations to fulfill the request
3. **Executes** each step with appropriate feedback
4. **Verifies** the results match expectations

Benefits:
- Handles complex, multi-step DevOps workflows
- Provides explanations at each stage
- Can recover from errors mid-process

Implementation:
- Use a chain-of-thought prompting technique
- Maintain state between reasoning steps
- Support plan modification based on execution results

### 3. Conversational Agent

Build on your existing chat interface to implement a fully conversational agent that:
- Maintains dialog context across interactions
- Supports clarification questions and refinements
- Provides progressive disclosure of technical details
- Offers natural language explanations of commands

Implementation:
- Extend your existing `chat.go` implementation
- Implement message history with context tracking
- Add support for different conversation modes (novice, expert)

## Technical Implementation

### Go-based Agent Core

Implement the agent core in Go, integrated with your existing Bubble Tea UI:

```go
// Agent represents the core Cloud-Assist agent
type Agent struct {
    // State and configuration
    context        *Context
    intentParser   *IntentParser
    cmdGenerator   *CommandGenerator
    outputAnalyzer *OutputAnalyzer
    modelClient    ModelClient
    executor       *CommandExecutor
    
    // Settings
    approvalMode   string
    verbosity      int
    maxContextSize int
}

// Process takes user input and returns agent response
func (a *Agent) Process(input string) (AgentResponse, error) {
    // 1. Parse intent
    intent, err := a.intentParser.Parse(input, a.context)
    if err != nil {
        return clarificationResponse(err)
    }
    
    // 2. Generate command(s)
    cmdSuggestions, err := a.cmdGenerator.GenerateCommands(intent, a.context)
    if err != nil {
        return errorResponse(err)
    }
    
    // 3. Request approval if needed
    approved, explanation := a.requestApproval(cmdSuggestions)
    if !approved {
        return rejectionResponse(explanation)
    }
    
    // 4. Execute command
    result, err := a.executor.Execute(cmdSuggestions.NextCommand())
    if err != nil {
        return errorResponse(err)
    }
    
    // 5. Analyze output and update context
    analysis := a.outputAnalyzer.Analyze(result)
    a.context.Update(analysis)
    
    // 6. Generate response
    return a.generateResponse(cmdSuggestions, result, analysis)
}
```

### Model Integration

Support multiple model backends through a common interface:

```go
// ModelClient defines the interface for AI model integration
type ModelClient interface {
    // Complete generates a completion for the given prompt
    Complete(ctx context.Context, prompt string, params ModelParams) (string, error)
    
    // GenerateEmbedding converts text to vector embedding
    GenerateEmbedding(ctx context.Context, text string) ([]float32, error)
}

// Implement specific clients
type OpenAIClient struct { /* ... */ }
type AnthropicClient struct { /* ... */ }
type LocalModelClient struct { /* ... */ }
```

### Context Management

Implement a flexible context structure:

```go
// Context manages the agent's understanding of state
type Context struct {
    // Command history
    commandHistory []CommandExecution
    
    // Environment information
    environment map[string]string
    
    // Resource state
    resources map[string]Resource
    
    // User preferences
    preferences UserPreferences
}

// Resource represents a tracked infrastructure component
type Resource struct {
    Type       string
    Identifier string
    State      map[string]interface{}
    Relations  []ResourceRelation
}
```

## Security Considerations

The agent must implement several security measures:

1. **Command Validation**: Check commands against permitted patterns
2. **Approval Workflow**: Multi-tiered approval based on risk assessment
3. **Credential Protection**: Never expose sensitive credentials in logs
4. **Audit Trail**: Log all suggested and executed commands
5. **Sandboxing**: Option to run commands in controlled environments

## Deployment Models

The Cloud-Assist agent can be deployed in multiple ways:

1. **Standalone CLI**: The current architecture with embedded agent
2. **Client-Server**: Agent runs as a service with multiple CLI clients
3. **IDE Integration**: Agent services exposed through editor extensions

## Roadmap for Implementation

1. **Phase 1**: Basic agent with intent parsing and command generation
2. **Phase 2**: Context tracking and improved command sequences
3. **Phase 3**: Output analysis and adaptive suggestions
4. **Phase 4**: Learning from user feedback
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced safety features and sandboxing

## Agent Evaluation Metrics

Measure the effectiveness of your agent using:

1. **Task Completion Rate**: Percentage of requests successfully fulfilled
2. **Command Acceptance Rate**: How often suggestions are approved
3. **Interaction Efficiency**: Number of exchanges to complete tasks
4. **Error Recovery**: Ability to recover from failed commands
5. **User Satisfaction**: Subjective ratings from users

## Conclusion

The proposed hybrid agent architecture combines the structured tool definitions of MCP with the conversational flow of your existing UI components and the multi-stage reasoning needed for complex DevOps tasks. This approach balances flexibility, safety, and user experience while leveraging your existing codebase.

By implementing this architecture, Cloud-Assist will deliver on its promise of being a powerful DevOps assistant that balances automation with user control, making complex infrastructure tasks more accessible while maintaining security and best practices.
