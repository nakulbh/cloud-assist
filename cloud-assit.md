# Cloud-Assist: DevOps Terminal Agent

## Overview

Cloud-Assist is a powerful terminal-based DevOps agent that helps automate common cloud and infrastructure tasks through an intuitive command-line interface. Using AI to understand intent, Cloud-Assist suggests, executes, and learns from shell commands to complete complex DevOps workflows.

## Features

- **Conversational Interface**: Describe what you want to accomplish in plain language
- **Command Suggestions**: Receive contextually appropriate shell commands
- **Command Approval**: Review and approve commands before execution
- **Output Analysis**: AI analyzes command output to determine next steps
- **Persistent Context**: Maintains understanding of your infrastructure throughout a session
- **Security-Focused**: All commands require explicit approval by default

## Use Cases

- Setting up and configuring cloud resources
- Troubleshooting infrastructure issues
- Deploying applications to various environments
- Managing Kubernetes clusters
- Configuring networking and security
- Automating repetitive DevOps tasks

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
```

### Basic Usage

1. Start a new session by describing your task:

   ```

2. Review and approve suggested commands
3. See results and next suggestions
4. Continue until your task is complete

## Command Approval
